      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to know technology to have a website?",
        "answer": "No. With the Essential package, we provide 1h of training for basic content management. With Managed, we handle everything for you — you just need to send us text/images when you want to update something."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens after the 1st month of included support (Essential)?",
        "answer": "The site is yours and stays online for free on Vercel. If you need additional support, we offer packages: €60/hour (ad-hoc) or pre-paid packages with discount."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I change my package later?",
        "answer": "Yes! If you start with Essential and want to upgrade to Managed, we credit your initial investment (€300 is deducted from the €800 setup). Migration is free."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does cancellation of the Managed package work?",
        "answer": "You can cancel with 30 days notice. Your plan and respective automations end at the end of the last billed period."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are \"operations\" in the Managed package?",
        "answer": "Each automatic interaction (e.g., form submitted, automatic email, Google Sheets update) consumes 1 operation. 2,500/month equals ~20 interactions/day, sufficient for most local businesses. We monitor usage and notify you if you're near the limit."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I exceed 2,500 operations?",
        "answer": "We notify you when you reach 80% of the limit. You have two options: upgrade to a higher plan or add +€30 per 1,000 extra operations. Occasional spikes are tolerated (fair use)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you only work in Lisbon?",
        "answer": "No. We work with clients throughout Portugal and also internationally (support in Portuguese and English). Online or in-person meetings (Lisbon area)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do automations work in practice?",
        "answer": "Essential: Direct buttons (WhatsApp, phone) and forms that send email. Managed: Complete flows — e.g., form → Telegram notification → Google Sheets entry → automatic client email → follow-up reminder."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I own the website and domain?",
        "answer": "Yes, in both packages. The developed source code is always yours. The domain is registered in your name. Important note: Automations are linked to our Make.com/Zapier accounts. If you cancel Managed, the basic site remains functional, but you lose the automatic features."
